# Open Web Tools Project
The Open Web Tools Project (OWTP) is all about providing a better suit of small tools that we use day to day online. While there has been tremendous advancement in terms of web technologies in the past few years, we feel commonly used small tools available via internet always had a worst web experience tied with an outdated ad-filled design. It's 2020 and we think we can do better. And that is what OWTP is all about.

Under OWTP, we aims to bring commonly used small tools under a single domain with a standardized architecture and design philosophy. This will be an open-source project where anyone can contribute. All services available will be free to use, ad-free and will have a design that promotes accessibility for all.
